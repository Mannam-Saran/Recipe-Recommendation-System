# Recipe Recommendation System

A machine learning project that recommends recipes based on user preferences and recipe features. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the construction of a content-based recommendation engine using nutritional and text features from a large recipe dataset.

## Project Overview

This project builds a Recipe Recommendation System using machine learning techniques. It cleans and analyzes a large dataset of recipes and user interactions, then applies content-based filtering to suggest recipes similar to those a user likes, based on ingredients, nutritional values, and recipe descriptions.

## Dataset

- **RAW_recipes.csv**: Contains recipe metadata, ingredients, steps, and nutritional values.
- **RAW_interactions.csv**: Contains user reviews and recipe ratings.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Analyzed recipe features such as number of steps, ingredients, and nutritional values.
- Visualized distributions and identified outliers.
- Filtered out extreme or unrealistic values to ensure data quality.

## Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned data by removing recipes with missing or zero values in key features.
- Split nutritional values into separate columns for easier analysis.
- Removed outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Reads recipe and review data using pandas.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts and cleans features such as calories, fat, sugar, and ingredients.
3. **Content-Based Recommendation**: Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity on text-based features (ingredients, steps, descriptions) to find similar recipes.
4. **Visualization**: Provides histograms and descriptive statistics to understand data distribution.

## Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JFA24SCM23M/ML-Project.git
    cd ML-Project
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Add a `requirements.txt` file if not present, or list your dependencies here: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.)*
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. Open and run `recipe-recommendation-system.ipynb`.

## Results

- Cleaned dataset with over 150,000 recipes.
- Visualizations showing distributions of recipe features.
- Content-based filtering model that can recommend similar recipes.
